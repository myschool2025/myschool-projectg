Actionable Steps to Improve Performance
1. Optimize JavaScript Execution (TBT, FCP, LCP)
Your report highlights excessive JavaScript execution time (2.4 s) and main-thread work (7.2 s). JavaScript-heavy applications can block rendering and interactivity.

Reduce Unused JavaScript (Savings: 7,352 KiB)
Issue: Large JavaScript bundles (e.g., lucide-react.js, html2pdf__js.js, recharts.js) are loaded, many of which may include unused code.
Solution:
Use code splitting to load only the JavaScript needed for the current page. For example, split large dependencies like recharts.js or html2pdf__js.js into smaller chunks loaded on-demand.
Implement tree shaking in your build process (e.g., with Vite or Webpack) to eliminate unused code.
Defer non-critical JavaScript using <script defer> or dynamic imports (e.g., import('module').then(...)).
Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives (e.g., consider a smaller charting library instead of recharts.js if possible).
Minify JavaScript (Savings: 4,333 KiB)
Issue: Unminified JavaScript increases file sizes and parse times.
Solution:
Enable minification in your build tool (e.g., Vite, Webpack, or Rollup). Use tools like Terser or UglifyJS.
Ensure all JavaScript files are minified in production, including third-party scripts like firebase_firestore.js.
Avoid Legacy JavaScript (Savings: 100 KiB)
Issue: Serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers increases parse and execution time.
Solution:
Use module/nomodule patterns to serve modern ES modules to compatible browsers and fallback scripts for older ones.
Optimize for modern browsers by transpiling only necessary polyfills with tools like Babel.
Reduce Main-Thread Work
Issue: The main thread is heavily occupied (7.2 s), with 2,026 ms spent on script evaluation and 480 ms on parsing.
Solution:
Offload heavy computations to Web Workers for tasks like data processing or calculations.
Use requestIdleCallback for non-critical tasks to run them when the main thread is idle.
Audit third-party scripts (e.g., Google Tag Manager, Chrome extensions) and remove or defer unnecessary ones.
2. Enable Text Compression (FCP, LCP)
Your report shows a potential savings of 9,850 KiB by enabling text compression.

Issue: Resources like lucide-react.js (1,233.7 KiB) and html2pdf__js.js (1,219.9 KiB) are not compressed, increasing download times.
Solution:
Enable gzip or Brotli compression on your server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, or Firebase Hosting).
Nginx Example:
nginx

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript;
Brotli Example (if supported):
nginx

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
brotli on;
brotli_types text/plain text/css application/javascript;
Verify compression using tools like Chrome DevTools (Network tab) or online compression checkers.
Ensure your CDN (if used) supports compression for static assets.
3. Optimize Images (FCP, LCP)
Image-related issues contribute to slow rendering.

Serve Images in Next-Gen Formats (Savings: 145 KiB)
Issue: Images are likely served in older formats like JPEG or PNG.
Solution:
Convert images to WebP or AVIF formats, which offer better compression and quality.
Use tools like ImageMagick or online converters (e.g., Squoosh) to batch-convert images.
Implement responsive images with <picture> or srcset to serve WebP/AVIF to supported browsers and fallback to JPEG/PNG.
Properly Size Images (Savings: 28 KiB)
Issue: Images are likely larger than needed for their display size.
Solution:
Use responsive images with srcset to serve appropriately sized images based on screen size.
Resize images server-side to match display dimensions (e.g., using a CMS or image optimization service like Cloudinary).
Avoid scaling images in CSS or HTML, as this wastes bandwidth.
Defer Offscreen Images (Savings: 86 KiB)
Issue: Images below the fold are loaded immediately, delaying FCP and LCP.
Solution:
Implement lazy loading using the loading="lazy" attribute on <img> tags.
Example: <img src="image.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
Use an Intersection Observer for custom lazy-loading logic if needed.
4. Reduce Layout Shifts (CLS: 0.57)
High CLS is caused by 5 layout shifts, with scores ranging from 0.001 to 0.570.

Issue: Elements like buttons, spans, and divs are shifting during page load, often due to dynamic content or late-loading resources.
Solution:
Reserve Space for Dynamic Content:
Set explicit width and height attributes on images and videos to prevent reflows.
Example: <img src="image.webp" width="300" height="200" alt="Description">
Use CSS aspect-ratio or min-height for containers with dynamic content (e.g., ads, widgets).
Avoid Late-Loading Fonts:
If using custom fonts, use font-display: swap in your @font-face CSS to prevent layout shifts during font loading.
Preload critical fonts: <link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>.
Stabilize Third-Party Widgets:
Audit third-party scripts (e.g., floating-whatsapp, Chrome extensions) causing shifts. Wrap them in containers with fixed dimensions.
Example: <div style="width: 300px; height: 200px;"><third-party-widget></div>.
Analyze Specific Elements:
Check the elements listed in the CLS audit (e.g., button.absolute, input.styles-module_input__WFb9L) and ensure they have stable sizes or are loaded after initial render.
5. Minimize Critical Request Chains (FCP, LCP)
Your report notes 108 critical request chains, which delay rendering.

Issue: Dependencies like firebase_firestore.js, recharts.js, and others create long chains of requests.
Solution:
Preload Critical Resources:
Use <link rel="preload"> for essential assets like main JavaScript bundles or CSS files.
Example: <link rel="preload" href="/main.js" as="script">.
Reduce Dependency Depth:
Bundle related dependencies into fewer files using your build tool.
Example: Combine smaller modules (e.g., @radix-ui_react-*) into a single chunk.
Defer Non-Critical Requests:
Load non-essential scripts (e.g., analytics, third-party widgets) after the main content using defer or async.
Example: <script src="analytics.js" async></script>.
6. Improve Back/Forward Cache (bfcache)
The page cannot use bfcache due to WebSocket usage.

Issue: WebSocket connections prevent bfcache, slowing navigation.
Solution:
If WebSocket is non-critical, consider closing the connection when the page is unloaded (e.g., in window.onunload).
Alternatively, use a service worker to cache critical resources for faster navigation, though this won’t fully replace bfcache.
Evaluate if WebSocket can be replaced with lighter alternatives like Server-Sent Events for specific use cases.
7. Reduce Third-Party Usage (TBT)
Third-party scripts (e.g., Google Tag Manager, Chrome extensions) block the main thread for 50 ms.

Issue: Scripts like content-all.js (Chrome extension) and Google Analytics add overhead.
Solution:
Defer Third-Party Scripts:
Load scripts like Google Tag Manager asynchronously or after page load.
Example: <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-L46WYR1SEQ"></script>.
Remove Unnecessary Extensions:
The Chrome extension difoiogjjojoaoomphldepapgpbgkhkb (Sider) consumes significant CPU (1,021 ms). Consider disabling it in production or testing environments.
Self-Host Critical Scripts:
If possible, host third-party scripts locally to reduce external requests and improve reliability.
8. Optimize CSS (FCP, LCP)
Unused CSS (136 KiB) and unminified CSS files (e.g., index.css) slow down rendering.

Issue: Large CSS files increase parse and render time.
Solution:
Remove Unused CSS:
Use tools like PurgeCSS or UnCSS to remove unused styles in production.
Analyze CSS coverage in Chrome DevTools (Coverage tab) to identify unused rules.
Minify CSS:
Enable CSS minification in your build tool (e.g., Vite’s css.minify option).
Critical CSS:
Extract critical CSS for above-the-fold content and inline it in the <head>.
Use tools like Critical or Penthouse to generate critical CSS.
9. Address Browser Errors
The report notes errors related to UNSAFE_componentWillMount in React.

Issue: Deprecated React lifecycle methods cause warnings and potential performance issues.
Solution:
Update the SideEffect(NullComponent2) component to use modern lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount or hooks like useEffect).
Example:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
useEffect(() => {
  // Move side effects here
}, []);
Audit your codebase for other deprecated APIs using ESLint rules (e.g., react/no-deprecated).
10. Additional Considerations
Reduce Network Payloads (Total Size: 13,080 KiB):
Prioritize critical resources and defer non-essential ones.
Use a CDN to cache static assets closer to users.
Avoid Non-Composited Animations:
Replace animations using properties like top or left with transform or opacity for better performance.
Example: transform: translateY(10px) instead of top: 10px.
Monitor User Timing Marks (4,856 timings):
Excessive user timings may indicate over-instrumentation. Audit analytics or performance tracking code to reduce overhead.
